# HWO_stars
This project aims to characterize nearby and bright stellar candidates that could host Earth-like planets. Our goal is to prepare for the future space telescope, HWO, as outlined in the Astro 2020 Decadal Survey, by studying the potential Sun-like host of Earth-like exoplanets. To achieve this, we analyzed the time-series photometry from the NASA TESS mission to determine the rotation of the stars. The rotation periods are particularly useful for Sun-like stars as they can provide insights into the ages of both the stars and their exoplanets. Precisely determining the age of a star is a challenging task, but their rotation periods offer one of the few readily measurable tools for age dating. We seek to age-date these stars along with any other characteristics that could affect their respective habitable zones.
